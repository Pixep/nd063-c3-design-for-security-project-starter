# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Move the application instance to a private subnet, accessible only to the ALB
- Disable SSH altogether on the instance

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
The recipes on the secret bucket needs to be encrypted on the client side, to make the content unusable, even if the bucket itself was compromised.
This will require another app to access encrypt/decrypt data from it.
