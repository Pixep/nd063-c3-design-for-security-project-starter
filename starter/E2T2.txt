## User related
A number of the security and compliance warnings related to the use of the root user, which should be replaced with specific IAM users

## EC2 related
The current server is publicly accessible, and should be on a private network instead. The appropriate security groups should be setup to only allow access from the load balancer.
The instance has SSH enabled and reachable publicly. This should be replaced by AWS System Manager, if needed, and not accessible publicly, or better, disabled altogether, and use only a pre-generated AWS image, with no external access

## S3
Ensure files are encrypted at rest with KMS, and that private recipes are encrypted on the client-side, "Privileged business users" can use an application instead of directly accessing S3

## Network
Modify security groups to be least access, place the app server in a private subnet (again), use NACL to block all ports / IP ranges not needed, and possibly monitor outbound traffic as well.

## Monitoring
Create multiple log metric filter and alarms to monitor changes on the key security components (S3 files access, NACL, network gateways, VPC, etc.)
