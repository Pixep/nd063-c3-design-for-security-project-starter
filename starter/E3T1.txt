# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty detected that:
- Our attack instance was performing an SSH Brute force attack against one of our instances
- The application instance was under an SSH Brute force attack

It also reports when the attack first started, and when it ended and the corresponding resource

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
From Guard Duty documentation, it uses
- CloudTrail (AWS user and API activity in your accounts)
- Amazon VPC Flow Logs (network traffic data)
- DNS Logs (name query patterns)

It then relies on machine learning to detect threats from these sources
